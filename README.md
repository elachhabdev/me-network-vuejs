# me-network-vue

🚀 Network Simulator done right — built with Vue.js

[HERE is Quick Look Start Playing With IT](https://me-network-vue.netlify.app/)

This project is both a learning playground for front-end development with Vue.js and a way to revisit the beauty of math through interactive patterns and visualization.

It’s not production-ready (yet) — the focus was on exploration over clean code or exhaustive testing. But I plan to revisit and improve it in the future. Hopefully, you’ll still find useful ideas or inspiration in it.
